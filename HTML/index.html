    <h2>Who is a Frontend Developer?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> is a professional who specializes in creating the user-facing part of a website—everything a
        person sees and interacts with in their browser. They are the architects of the digital experience, responsible
        for turning a static design into a living, breathing, and interactive webpage.</p>
    <p>Their primary job is to use <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</em> to build visual elements, layouts, buttons, and animations
        that make a website functional and enjoyable to use. They bridge the gap between <mark>design and technology</mark>, ensuring the website not only looks good but is also responsive, accessible, and fast.</p>
